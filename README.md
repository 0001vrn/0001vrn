# Varun Thakur(0001vrn)
ðŸ”­ I am a software developer, an open-source contributor and an avid learner working on backend technologies using Java/Kotlin, Spring and AWS. In my free time, I write articles about my learnings and experiences with different technology or tools. I love exploring new technologies and have published articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@001vrn) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/meta-binary-search-one-sided-binary-search/).
